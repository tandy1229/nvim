This is my neovim configuration.

Most of the configurations is inspired by @theniceboy.

Anyway, it's **AWESOME** !!!

Just enjoy~~~

================

Due to I use 60 plugins to make my nvim more effective. My neovim become dull sometimes.

I try to make my vimrc file more simple to shortup its startup time, etc.

Doing these things makes my neovim run faster.

**So with these effects, its startup just uses 170ms with those plugins!!!**
