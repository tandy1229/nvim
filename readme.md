This is my nvim configs.

In my view, it's **AWESOME** !!!

The most of neovim config is inspired by @theniceboy.

In the past, I am not familiar with neovim. And I add more plugins to my vimrc but I just know a few plugins' feather. But now I know I have to read more **Offical Documents** of these plugins . And so.

To improve the level of my English, I need to make more effect.

( And in my situation, I have to pass the CET4 in the last month of 2020
