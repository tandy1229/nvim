## awesome nvim config

<center><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/11/19/trADL8Oag9VCYmI.png"</center>

This are my nvim configurations.

In my view, it's **AWESOME** !!!

The most of neovim config is inspired by @theniceboy.

In the past, I am not familiar with neovim. And I add more plugins to my vimrc but I just know a few of these plugins' feather. 

I used to modify my vimrc by Baidu, and never had seen the offical Document. No matter what CommandLineTool I use, I never want to browse it, because I can't understand all of these English words. But now I know I have to read more **Offical Documents** of these plugins. And so.

To improve the level of my English, I need to make more effect.

( And in my situation, I have to pass the CET4 in the last month of 2020
