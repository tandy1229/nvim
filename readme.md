# AWESOME NEOVIM CONFIG

<center><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/12/02/KdbP1m5t8Z2D4Xg.png"</center>

Here are my neovim configurations.

The most of neovim configurations is glorious by @theniceboy.

Anyway, it's **AWESOME** !!!

Just enjoy~~~

================

Because I use more than 50 plugins to use my nvim more effective. My neovim become slowly sometimes. So I try to make my vimrc file more simple to shortup its startup time, etc.

Doing these things makes my neovim run faster.

**So with these effects, its startup just uses 170ms with those plugins!!!**
