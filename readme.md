This is my awesome nvim configs.

the most configs of my nvim is inspired by @theniceboy.

In the past, I am not familiar with neovim. And I add more plugins to my vimrc but I just know a few plugins' feather. But now I know I have to read more **Offical Documents of these plugins** . And so.

(In my situation, I have to pass the CET4 in the last month of 2020
